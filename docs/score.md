# Scoring Criteria
The exact scoring criteria is currently being developed, but will be composed of:
1. Legal routing solution (must pass for valid score)
2. Wall-clock time (large weight)
3. Wirelength of critical-path (small weight)
4. *Other to-be-announced criteria*

Over time, we plan to release a number of additional public benchmarks on which all competing routers will be evaluated on.
Entrants will also be evaluated on a set of hidden benchmarks which will not be made public.
